# ProbabilisticMethods

I hereby present the results of the assignements from the "Probablistic Methods in AI" class given by Pr Chris Pal. The assignment require a good deal of prior knowledge: Bayesian Network, Markov Random Fields, Decision Trees and others. They give a solid background to anyone interested in Neural Networks.
