# ProbabilisticMethods

This repository contains the assignements from the "Probablistic Methods in AI" class given by Pr Chris Pal. These implementations require a good deal of prior knowledge: Bayesian Network, Markov Random Fields, Decision Trees and others. They give a solid background to anyone interested in Neural Networks.
